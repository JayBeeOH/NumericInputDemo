NUMERIC INPUT DEMO

<p>There are many ways to receive numeric data in a Windows Forms application. The app demonstrates the KeyPress event to control and suppress the user's input.  Also, the app shows the Validating event where several validations functions can be implemented to test the validity of the user's input. In the demonstration, the ErrroProvider is used to give feedback to the user of corrections that need to be performed before the data is accepted.</p>

<p>The NumericInputDemo app was coded in Visual Basic .NET.</p>
